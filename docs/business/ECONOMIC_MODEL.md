# PULSAR STUDIO — ECONOMIC MODEL
Version: 1.0 Stable

# 1. Revenue Model
Primary product:
30-second vertical marketplace video
Price range:
$7 – $16 (entry tier)
Premium tier (future):
$27 – $50

# 2. Cost Structure (COGS)
Estimated per video:
AI generation (image):
$0.01 – $0.05
Motion (pseudo or light GPU):
$0.02 – $0.20
Assembly (FFmpeg + compute time):
$0.02 – $0.10
Storage + bandwidth:
$0.01 – $0.05
---------------------------------
Total Estimated COGS:
$0.10 – $0.50

# 3. Gross Margin
At $7 price:
COGS $0.50 → Margin ≈ 93%
At $16 price:
COGS $0.50 → Margin ≈ 96%
High-margin low-overhead model.

# 4. Break-Even Calculation
Monthly survival target:
€300
Required revenue:
€300 ≈ $330
At $7 per video:
≈ 47 videos/month
At $10 per video:
≈ 33 videos/month
Target operational average:
35 videos/month

# 5. GPU Cost Rule
If GPU cost per video > $0.50
→ fallback to pseudo-motion
GPU enhances quality, not survival.

# 6. Economic Guardrail Rule
No feature may be added unless it:
- Increases revenue
- Reduces cost
- Improves conversion
- Shortens production time
Otherwise: rejected.

# 7. Scalability
Fixed costs: near zero  
Infrastructure: on-demand  
No physical production  
Scaling = linear with demand
