# PULSAR STUDIO — MONETIZATION RULEBOOK
Version: 1.0
Status: Mandatory During Survival Phase

# 1. Core Principle
Revenue precedes innovation.
If it does not generate money, it does not get built.

# 2. Survival Mode Lock
While monthly revenue < €300:
❌ No new architecture  
❌ No experimental GPU builds  
❌ No feature polishing  
❌ No redesign  
❌ No "optimization for beauty"  
Only actions allowed:
✔ Generate demo  
✔ Contact sellers  
✔ Close payment  
✔ Deliver video  

# 3. 7-Day Rule
Any feature that delays sales more than 7 days is automatically rejected.

# 4. GPU Restriction
GPU is optional enhancement.
If:
- It increases cost
- It delays sales
- It adds instability
It is disabled.

# 5. Sales Priority Rule
Every working day must include at least one revenue-oriented action:
- Sending outreach message
- Following up with seller
- Producing demo
- Closing payment
No day may be "pure engineering" during survival phase.

# 6. Feature Admission Criteria
A feature may only be implemented if:
- It increases conversion rate
- OR increases price per video
- OR reduces production cost
- OR reduces production time
If none apply → rejected.

# 7. Psychological Protection Rule
Engineering must not become an emotional escape from selling.
Discomfort of sales is not a reason to modify the system.

# 8. Exit Condition
When:
€300+ for 2 consecutive months
Then:
- Feature expansion allowed
- GPU scaling allowed
- Premium tier allowed
Until then:
Stay in monetization mode.
