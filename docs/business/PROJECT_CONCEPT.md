# PULSAR STUDIO — PROJECT CONCEPT
Version: 1.0 Stable
Status: Monetization Phase

# 1. Mission
Pulsar Studio is a production system for generating high-conversion vertical product videos for marketplace sellers.
We do not sell AI.
We do not sell technology.
We sell conversion-oriented product videos.

# 2. Core Product
Primary product:
30-second vertical commercial video (9:16)
Specifications:
- 1080x1920 resolution
- Fast pacing (1.5–3 sec cuts)
- Bright, saturated visuals
- Background music
- Subtitle overlay
- Watermark before payment
- Clean version after payment
No physical filming.
No studio.
No manual editing dependency.

# 3. Target Customer
Small marketplace sellers who:
- Have product photos
- Do not have video
- Want to improve listing performance
- Cannot afford traditional production
Initial market focus:
Brazil (Amazon / Mercado Livre)

# 4. Business Model
Entry pricing:
$7 – $16 per video
Estimated COGS:
$0.10 – $0.50
Gross margin:
80–90%
Break-even target:
~35 videos per month
Primary objective:
€300/month stability

# 5. Architectural Principle
Core remains stable.
Pipeline:
Image → Motion → Assembly → Watermark → Delivery
External services may change:
- Vertex
- RunPod
- Local GPU
- CPU fallback
Core logic must remain service-independent.

# 6. Economic Guardrail
No feature is added without economic justification.
If a feature:
- Does not increase revenue
- Does not reduce cost
- Does not improve conversion
It is not implemented.
Revenue first. Optimization second.

# 7. Growth Strategy
Phase 1:
Survival mode (€300/month)
Phase 2:
Scaling volume (50–150 videos/month)
Phase 3:
Premium tier (GPU-enhanced cinematic mode)

# 8. Operating Philosophy
Monetization precedes innovation.
System improvements occur only after validated revenue.
Stability over perfection.
Cashflow over complexity.

# 9. Definition of Success
The system is successful when:
- It generates consistent monthly revenue
- It operates predictably
- It does not depend on manual chaos
- It allows financial stability
