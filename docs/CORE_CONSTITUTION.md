# PULSAR STUDIO CORE CONSTITUTION v1.0

Status: Active  
Authority: Mandatory  
Scope: Applies to all architectural, technical, and product decisions

---

## I. Core Invariance

1. The Core is separated from external services.
2. The Core does not depend on any single provider.
3. Services may change. The Core does not.

Core includes:
- Orchestration logic
- Agent protocol structure
- Economic validation layer
- Architecture rules

---

## II. Brain ≠ Compute

1. LLM layer is separated from GPU layer.
2. Orchestration is separated from rendering.
3. Intelligence layer must not be tightly coupled to compute provider.

---

## III. Duality Principle (Non-Negotiable)

1. Minimum two LLM providers.
2. Minimum two compute strategies (Cloud / Rental / Local).
3. No vendor lock-in.

Fallback is not optional. It is mandatory.

---

## IV. Economic Filter (Mandatory Gate)

Any change must satisfy at least one:

- Increase margin
- Reduce cost
- Accelerate monetization
- Improve scalability
- Increase system autonomy

If none apply — change is rejected.

---

## V. Tech + Marketing + Monetization Coupling

1. No demo without market validation.
2. No feature that delays revenue beyond 7 days.
3. Super-features allowed only after stable monetization level.

Revenue precedes expansion.

---

## VI. Feature Control

Before reaching stable 300€ monthly profit:

- No experimental features
- No architecture redesign
- No unnecessary refactoring
- No aesthetic-driven development

Focus: Revenue Stabilization

---

## VII. Cold Decision Rule

No decisions made:

- Under emotional pressure
- Under panic
- Under hype
- Under external influence

All decisions must align with this Constitution.
